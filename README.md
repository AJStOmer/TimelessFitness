Introduction
Gym’s are a prime location for growth and healthy living, the trend in the industry seems
to be expensive memberships yet overcrowding. A gym can only have a finite amount of
equipment so the way it’s used is crucial. Therefore, our project “Timeless Fitness” brings a new
wave into the fitness market by solving a crucial problem among many. As regular gym
members we have noticed that if you go during regular hours, the gym is always crowded, and
the wait time for each machine is glaring issue. For example, as busy students it is very hard to
fit in a workout session knowing we could be there for multiple hours, that's why we have
decided to commit ourselves to this issue and create a project to solve it. Our solution to this
overcrowded gym problem is a method to book your machines in advance at the gym for your
specific routine. Since you have to book a machine we can control the number of people in the
gym to decrease the waiting time among other people, thus maximizing the efficiency of the
gym.

Problem
The gym has always been a prominent place for many peoples lives; throughout the
years there has not been much change to how a gym is operated, which is understandable
given that a gym does accomplish its goal of allowing members to exercise. Nevertheless, a
vital issue that is rarely ever addressed is the waiting time within the gym in itself. We found
ourselves spending a large part of our time waiting for machines to open up, specific weights to
be available, mats, showers, and considerably anything and everything within the gym. As
students who struggle to find time to even initially go to the gym, it is very demotivating knowing
that we will be wasting time just waiting. This usually would eventually lead us to completely
stop attending the gym, which for obvious reasons can and does cause many issues in our day
to day life.
This problem happens at most gyms and at most times, due to the sheer volume of
people trying to workout, this problem has become ubiquitous. Most gyms, if not all, do not offer
any sort of solution, but rather just try to state times where the gym is less busy, but when they
do so, everyone switches to that time leading yet again to a busy gym. Overall, from our
experience through several gyms, none offer any solution to such a vital issue that clearly needs
a solution similar to any busy restaurant for example, reservation/booking. This overall
decreases the gym’s efficiency, decreasing profit as well as affecting members overall time
drastically, decreasing overall attendance.

Solution
Most restaurants, movie theaters, events, etc have some sort of application to stop such
a problem from occurring at any point of time. This application is generally some sort of
booking/managing times, events, equipment, tables, movie theater and more depending on the
sort of business in question. Although this does mean specific times are restricted for specific
people, it does mean that when it is your time, then it truly is your time with no wasting time
waiting or restrictions on a specific part of the experience due to it being overcrowded.
Henceforth, why not implement such a method to the gym?
This project will see the development of a web application which allows for booking
management for all aspects of the gym, and users of the application will be able to book
different aspects of the gym and their desired time when available, this includes benches,
machines, courts and even personal trainers. By allowing for such a booking feature we enable
all members of the gym to be able to assign a time for them, to be able to accomplish whatever
they need and accomplish all at once with no waiting; that is what we call timeless fitness! They
will have a schedule of all the times available for any machines they need, personal trainers,
and even courts, allowing them to book a time that is available, securing them everything they
need without the need of waiting around and wasting precious time from their busy lives. Our
website include all the available features of the gym as detailed previously, each user will be
able to choose any of the available features and select a booking time for that specific entity; for
example, let's assume someone is looking to have an upper body workout session, that person
is able to book all the machines wanted, such as the lateral pull, chest fly machine and possibly
implement some cardio so a rowing machine, they will be able to book each machine for 30 min
intervals at the required yet available time. Furthermore, the person is also able to book a
personal trainer if needed, or even a court for some sporting sessions also within specific time
intervals. Our project also includes functionality for employees such as managers, they are able
to manage the bookings of Members and manage the actual bookables themselves such as
Machines, PT Sessions and courts, in addition, they are able to make announcements to relay
information to all members. There will also be personal trainers available for bookings to help
Members, another role of PT’s will be to make programs that Members can choose to enroll in
